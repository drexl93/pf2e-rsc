# PF2e Lockpicking
This is a simple little module that supports the automation of Pathfinder 2e's "multiple successes" rules on lockpicking.

## Installation:
Copy the following link into your Manifest URL bar in the Module Installation window of Foundry VTT: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drexl93/pf2e-lockpicking/master/module.json

## Usage:
1. GM selects the token of the actor attempting the lockpicking.
2. GM uses the supplied macro (in the PF2e Lockpicking Compendium) to choose a type of lock.
    - Selecting 'Custom' allows them to input their own amount of successes required as well as the DC.
3. Once the type of lock is selected, the owner(s) of the actor selected will get a pop-up asking them if they have any bonuses to add, and prompting them to roll.
    - The player may wish to roll each attempt individually, or they may wish to select the 'Autopick' option to keep trying until they either succeed or critically fail.
    - Hovering over the number of the result in the chat shows a breakdown of the roll.

## Endnotes:
Let me know if you have any feedback about this module/if you run into any bugs! The best way to get in touch with me is via Discord (Some Knucklehead#4725).

As always, I'm eternally grateful to the folks at the Discord channel for Foundry VTT for helping me learn my way around modules, macros, and javascript in general. Special thanks this time goes out to user vance, whose model macros (https://github.com/VanceCole/macros) have proven invaluable.
